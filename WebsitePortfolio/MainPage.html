                    <p>
                    My name is Douglas Lopez, born in 1998 in San Salvador, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the California
                    State Universiry Dominguez Hills. My passion for technology started early when my parents bought me the Playstation 2. I am also passionate 
                    about art and architecture with a degree in architecture in progress. I am a hard-working person that was encouraged by his parents
                    to always strive for the best as anything is achievable with enough hard-work and dedication.
                    This website portfolio is a quick way to access my projects.

                        is available on a private YouTube link, with plans for a future release on Steam.</p>

                        valuable experience in configuration management, version control, build systems, and project documentation. Through cloning the 
                        repository, using Git commands, and employing CMake GUI, I honed my skills in managing large software projects. Additionally, I
                        studied the flow of control for different mesh operators using the debug configuration build of Blender and our preferred IDE. 
                        Lastly, I conducted unit testing of fundamental Blender vector operations using Python scripts and the Python unit test framework.</p>
